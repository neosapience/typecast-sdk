# Typecast SDK Development Rules

## Backward Compatibility (CRITICAL)

All SDKs must maintain backward compatibility. Breaking changes are strongly discouraged.

- Do NOT remove or rename existing public APIs
- Do NOT change method signatures in ways that break existing code
- Use deprecation warnings before removing features
- Add new parameters as optional with sensible defaults
- When in doubt, maintain compatibility over introducing new patterns

## Cross-SDK Consistency

SDKs should maintain similar structure and API patterns across languages where feasible.

**However**, language-specific idioms and runtime characteristics take precedence:
- Follow each language's conventions and best practices
- Respect language-specific patterns (e.g., async/await in JS, goroutines in Go)
- Use native error handling mechanisms

## OpenAPI Specification

If an `openapi.json` file exists at the project root, use it as the **source of truth** for:
- API endpoint definitions
- Request/response schemas
- Model definitions
- Error codes and messages

## Code Quality Standards

### File Length Limit
Keep all source files under 450 lines. If a file exceeds this limit:
- Split into logical modules/classes
- Extract helper functions to separate files

### Comments and Documentation
**All comments must be written in English.** This includes:
- Inline code comments
- Function/method documentation
- README files and guides

### Security Requirements (CRITICAL)

- NO private keys, secrets, or credentials in code
- NO API keys committed to the repository
- Use `.env.example` files to document required environment variables
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure HTTP connections (HTTPS only)

## Additional Context

For complete guidelines, refer to [CLAUDE.md](mdc:CLAUDE.md) in the project root.
